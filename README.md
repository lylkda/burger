# burger
In this app, Node and MySQL is used to query and route data to log our burgers. A homemade ORM helps with the querying. Handlebars generates the HTML. 

## What it does
This app lets users input the name of burgers they'd like to eat. Each burger has a Devour button and upon clicking it, the burger will move to right column, indicating it has been eaten. 

MySQL will store every burger that has or has not been eaten.
